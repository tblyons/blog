In my personal development, I've tried to keep all my non-stand-alone app ideas in a single library.
This desire can probably be traced back to my discovery of [JUCE](https://juce.com/).
JUCE is a single high-quality framework for building applications.
While it is organized by modules, it still contained a huge variety of functionality in a single library.

One of the projects that I would like to implement is a budgeting/double entry accounting app similar to [Ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/).
But every time I started implementing the app, I would get sidetracked by representing money.
Money typically has fractional components and all currencies I am aware of use decimal based representations.
But floating point types can't represent tenths or hundredths exactly!

```
class Decimal_float {
  float mValue;
public:
  Decimal_foat(float value) : mValue(value) { }
}; // class Decimal_float
```
* 7.2 decimal digits of precision
* Capable of representing $100 thousand precisely
* Size: 4 bytes
* Padding: 0 bytes

```
class Decimal_double {
  double mValue;
public:
  Decimal_double(double value) : mValue(value) { }
}; // class Decimal_double
```
* 15.9 decimal digits of precision
* Capable of representing $10 trillion precisely
* Size: 8 bytes
* Padding: 0 bytes

```
class Decimal_int32_int32 {
  int32_t mMantissa;
  int32_t mExponent;
public:
  Decimal_int32_int32(float value)
}; // class Decimal_int32_int32
```
* 9.3 decimal digits of precision
* Capable of representing $10 million precisely
* Size: 8 bytes
* Padding: 0 bytes

```
class Decimal_int64_int32 {
  int64_t mMantissa;
  int32_t mExponent;
public:
  Decimal_int64_int32(double value)
}; // class Decimal_int64_int32
```
* 18.9 decimal digits of precision
* Capable of representing $10,000 trillion precisely
* Size: 12 bytes
* Padding: 4 bytes
