In my personal development, I've tried to keep all my non-stand-alone app ideas in a single library.
This desire can probably be traced back to my discovery of [JUCE](https://juce.com/).
JUCE is a single high-quality framework for building applications.
While it is organized by modules, it still contained a huge variety of functionality in a single library.
